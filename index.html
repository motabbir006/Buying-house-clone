                    the market. As a result, the demand and supply of garments are getting affected.</p>

                <p id="p1">As the demand and supply are affected, the price of the product depends on that. So, garment
                    manufacturing companies are always conscious of the price of their product. Garments Manufacturing
                    House should take care of the quality of the product. If the quality of the product is good then

                    the sale of garments.</p>

                    proper liaison office between the buyer and the garments manufacturing house. This proper office can
                    be built or can be constructed by the buyer himself. The best place to locate the liaison office is
                    near the industries and the buyers.

                    garments, wholesaler, and retailer. The manufacturer of the product needs to be properly located so
                    that he can supply the orders immediately. The wholesaler who acts as the retailer needs to be found
                    in close proximity to the manufacturer so that the retailer can take an immediate order from him and
                    forward it to the manufacturer. The third function is the order execution from the supplier.</p>

                    garment
                    industry because the export of garments from this country far outpaces the production of cotton in
                    other
                    countries. A lot of local and foreign buyers are attracted to buying clothes manufactured in this

                <h1 id="lia"> Bangladesh: The 2nd Largest Textile Exporter</h1>
                <p id="p1"> Bangladesh is the second-largest South Asian nation after India. As far as the textile
                    industry in
                    Bangladesh is concerned, there has been significant growth in the past few years. The Dhaka-based
                    Garments Buying House has become the best option for buyers looking for high quality and trendy

                    top
                    European and American brands.</p>

                <h1 id="lia"> Why Bangladesh is the Best for Sourcing Apparels?</h1>
                <p id="p1"> The Bangladesh Produce Market is highly diversified with millions of products. The region
                    plays a vital
                    role in the export sector and most of the exporters have set their base here. The growth in exports
                    has
                    been tremendous and has made it the most profitable sector in the country. The exporter gets
                    lucrative
                    margins when the product reaches the overseas market. A huge chunk of the budget is spent on buying
                    raw
                    materials from the neighboring and key regions of the country. This vital role is fulfilled by the
                    Dhaka
                    based garment buying house.</p>

                </div>
                <p id="p1">It can be rightly said that the Garments Buying House has played a vital role in shaping the
                    modern-day clothing industry of Bangladesh. The exporters from this sector have a diversified order
                    processing network to meet the requirements of the buyers worldwide. The exporters take care of all
                    the complexities involved while the orders are being processed. This helps the buyer to get hold of
                    the best quality garments without hassles.</p>

                <h1 id="lia"> Conclusion</h1>
                <p id="p1">Most of the factories in Bangladesh assemble a different variety of apparels like tops,
                    bottoms,
                    trousers, dresses, etc. Most of these garments manufacturers are based in the coastal regions of the
                    country. These factories process the orders placed by the buyers and dispatch them to the desired
                    destinations within the shortest time possible. Moreover, they also provide customers with excellent
                    discounts and freebies on their purchase. Most of the buyers prefer to buy branded clothes rather
                    than
                    local and non-branded products as the latter might not meet their requirements and quality
                    standards.</p>
